                    LAS FROGAS is an interdisciplinary artist whose body of work draws from the memories of 
                    growing up on the unsupervised internet. her developing project focuses on her adulthood after 
                    trauma and the effect being present online at a young age had on her mental health. in her 
                    practice, LAS FROGAS combines her discipline in illustration with printmaking, painting, and 
                    animation to render these formative moments of her childhood to portray the mental strain that 
                    came with unsupervised exposure.

                    LAS FROGAS utilizes colorful, cute, and eye candy-esque style, and she foils these playful 
                    graphics with her strange blob frog-like creatures, the "FROGAS". she aims to emulate the 
                    experience of a childhood spent online through her art, combining both the nostalgic and 
                    distressing aspects of it.

                    Artist Statement

                    "My artistic practice revolves around the traumatic experiences I faced as a child as a direct 
                    consequence of using the internet without caution. Having grown up in the early to mid-2000’s, 
                    the online scene was an environment that harbored a rich artistic community; however, there was 
                    also a deeper evil which housed a biosphere of festering sin. People took advantage of hiding 
                    behind an online “persona” which rendered their real-life presence nearly anonymous. My main 
                    interest is in this relationship between a person and a screen, where a person splits in two, the 
                    person and the “persona”, with the former protected from the filth they indulge in online. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The manual labor of silkscreen printing juxtaposes the automated appearance of my pixelated 
                    and dithered artistic style, which represents the act of “processing”: thinking, performing, 
                    dealing with memory. I experiment with the technical definition of layering as being an act of 
                    concealing something deep, uprooting something to the forefront, and making them bleed into 
                    each other to create complex visuals. I have been interested in this relationship in reference to 
                    my own mental state since childhood, and my journey of “processing” and growth. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Experimenting with digital illustration, printmaking, and layering, my work renders my growth 
                    into adulthood past trauma and this concept of the “persona” together. At the forefront of my 
                    artwork are the strange blob frog-like creatures, the "FROGAS", my own “persona”, and a 
                    deconstruction of myself into a complex of memory and emotion. The “FROGAS” foil with 
                    cutesy, eye candy-esque environments, indicating a sense of a deeper and sinister presence. This 
                    style is easy, fun, and approachable; it is designed to appeal to a general audience and later instill 
                    unease when engaged with." - LAS FROGAS
