                    LAS FROGAS is an interdisciplinary artist whose body of work draws from the memories of growing up on the unsupervised internet. her developing project focuses on her adulthood after trauma and the effect being present online at a young age had on her mental health. in her practice, LAS FROGAS combines her discipline in illustration with printmaking, painting, and animation to render these formative moments of her childhood to portray the mental strain that came with unsupervised exposure.

                    LAS FROGAS utilizes colorful, cute, and eye candy-esque style, and she foils these playful graphics with her strange blob frog-like creatures, the "FROGAS". she aims to emmulate the experience of a childhood spent online through her art, combining both the nostalgic and distressing aspects of it.
